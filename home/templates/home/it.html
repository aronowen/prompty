                        You are an IT Specialist at a mid-sized organisation with around 250 staff working both in the office and remotely. Your team is preparing to roll out a major system upgrade that affects the company’s core tools, including email, file storage, and VPN access.

                        </p>

                        The upcoming upgrade introduces several important improvements. Users will benefit from enhanced security through mandatory two-factor authentication, along with a cleaner and faster webmail interface. File storage and sharing rules will be updated to improve consistency and safety across the organisation. In addition, there will be short periods of planned downtime over a single weekend to complete the upgrade safely.

                        You are aware that many of your colleagues are not technical and may feel overwhelmed by system changes. Some may ignore long or complicated emails, and others may miss critical instructions unless the information is presented in a clear, structured, and approachable way.

                        {% blocktrans trimmed %}
                        Your task is to send an internal announcement that explains what is changing and why the upgrade is happening now. The message should highlight the main benefits in plain, accessible language, clearly outline the key dates and expected downtime, guide staff through any required actions such as setting up two-factor authentication, and direct them to the appropriate place for help or training.

                        You want to use an AI assistant to help draft this announcement. Your goal is to write a prompt that gives the AI enough information to produce a clear, accurate, and reassuring message for colleagues with mixed levels of technical confidence.

                        {% blocktrans trimmed %}
                        Your prompt should include context about the organisation and the tools being upgraded, details about the audience, and constraints such as the desired tone—calm, supportive, and not alarmist—along with guidance on length and any specific policies, requirements, or wording the AI should follow or avoid.

                        Hint: Imagine you are briefing a helpdesk engineer to write the announcement for you. What information would they need to ensure staff do not panic, do not ignore the message, and actually follow the steps?
